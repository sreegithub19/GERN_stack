Steps to run GERN_stack (G:Github, E:Express, R:React, N:Node.js):<br>
(1) Commands to run the app:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) npm install express-generator -g<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) npm install -g express<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) express myapp<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) cd myapp<br>
(2) Replace the contents in app.js file with the content given here.<br>
(3) I have renamed the index.html file (in the public folder) to jetpunk.html. Replace the code in that file with the content given here.<br>
(4) This is the site I referred to: https://www.jetpunk.com/. Save this webpage as webpage , and rename the downloaded folder as "jetpunk". Ignore the downloaded html file.<br>
(5) To store the "jetpunk" folder in your system and run the express app, it should be stored in public/images folder.<br>
(6) Next set of commands to be run (in the myapp folder):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) npm init<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) npm install<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) npm start<br>
(7) The app starts running at: http://localhost:3000/jetpunk.html<br>
(8) Some of the links of the files belonging to the "jetpunk" folder have been used directly from the "jetpunk" folder uploaded here in github, which enables Github to act as a database for some of our code files, hence the name GERN. (All files in the "jetpunk" folder cannot be used in a similar way due to CORS issues).<br>
